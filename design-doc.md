### Basic rules

Every player will have a stable of 5 wrestlers. The wrestlers will be from the following ranks:

1 from the yokozuna/ozeki ranks
1 from the sekiwake/komusubi ranks
1 from maegashira 1-5
1 from maegashira 6-10
1 from maegashira 11+

Wrestlers in a stable will gain points for winning bouts and also from achievements like getting a kinboshi or winning the tournament etc. There will also be a couple of ways that points will be deducted from a stable (make-koshi and trading penalties).

### Drafting

A wrestler can only be in a limited number of stables. This number will be a fraction of the total number of people in the league, and whoever is running the league can adjust it for every rank level. For example, in this basho we said that a wrestler could only be held by 1/3 (rounded down) of the players in the league. I think that worked fine. Some people suggested it could be 1/4 to make it more interesting. I think that works fine for the maegashira, but could get tight for y/o and s/k ranks. If the rule is adjustable then leagues could tweak it to work best for them.

For the draft, each player makes a ranked list of the 3 wrestlers they would like at every rank level. Once these lists have all been submitted, the draft randomizes, and then applies the picks in a snake (i.e. y/o picks go ABCDE and then s/k picks go EDCBA and then m1-5 picks go ABCDE etc.). If someone's 1st choice is full by the time the snake reaches them, it takes their second choice, and so on. The randomize list for the draft will be used for the trading wire, but reversed (i.e. if the draft is ABCDE then the wire will start at EDCBA on day 1).

### Trading

Players can trade for the first 7 days of the tournament. All trading stops once bouts start on nakabi, or middle Sunday. To trade, you choose a wrestler from a given rank set to get rid of, and another from the same set to pick up. Trading follows the same rules as drafting in that if, say, 1/3 of the people in the league have a given wrestler you cannot choose them in a trade. Trades must be submitted before 4 pm Japan time each day to be valid for that day. The trades will be processed at 4 pm Japan time. There is free trading before matches start on day 1. Once the basho starts, everyone gets on free trade. The second trade incurs a -.5 point penalty, and every subsequent trade is a -1 point penalty.

Priorities in terms of conflicts in a trade will be determined by the trading wire, i.e. someone in 1st position in the wire will beat someone in 3rd position if they both want the same wrestler, but only one can get him. Once someone does a trade they are placed at the bottom of the wire, and everyone else moves up. If multiple people trade on the same day, they are placed at the bottom of the wire in the order that they were higher up in the wire. Therefore if the wire for the league is ABCDEF, and A, C, and F trade, then the wire will be BDEACF for the next day.

If 2 people want the same wrestler, but only one can have him, then the person who loses out swaps positions on the bottom of the wire with the person who beat them*. Therefore if the wire is ABCDEF and A, C, and F trade, but A gets F's choice because of the wire, then the new wire will be BCEFCA.

*I'm pretty sure I like this rule, but I would be interested in people's input

### Scoring

Points will be granted in the following ways:

1 pt. for each win
5 pts. for the championship or yusho
3 pts for the runner-up, or jun-yusho
3 pts for a special prize, or sansho
2 pts for a gold star victory, or kinboshi
1 pt. for a winning record, or kachi-koshi
-.5 pt. for a losing record, or make-koshi
-.5 pt. for your second trade
-1 pt. for every trade beyond the first 2

There are a couple of special rules in scoring as it relates to trading. You get the make-koshi penalty for a wrestler even if you traded them away. You only get the kachi-koshi score from a wrestler who is in your stable at the end of the tournament. You only get the kinboshi score from a wrestler if they scored the kinboshi while they were in your stable AND if you still have them at the end of the tournament. The jun-yusho points will not be awarded if 3 or more wrestlers are tied for second place in terms of their record.

Here are the tie-breakers, in order:

Yusho
Jun-yusho
Total Sansho
Total Kinboshi
Total kachi-koshi
Fewest trades

There are a couple of fiddly things in terms of trading and drafting, but I don't think it'll be a super complicated system â€“ basically a spreadsheet with a gui. The real fancy stuff would be if we could pull information from http://sumo.or.jp/EnHonbashoMain/torikumi/1/15/ so that it updated automatically. Also: I just registered https://www.fantasy-sumo.com.
